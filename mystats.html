    The intresting fact about me would be, the last time i visited vizag we travelled around the city 
    and the famous places which drained me and i accidentally took the wrong train and got lost but 
    during that time i met a nice local man who helped me out to get back to my family who were very worried
    about me. I got yelled it and i still remember all those to this day it was a plesant yet scary experience.

<h3> Lobster </h3>
<p> Its meat is sweet and tender. It's similar in taste to a crab but sweeter, cleaner, and lighter.
     Its consistency is a hybrid between a crab and a shrimp. It's so tender it almost melts in your 
     mouth.
